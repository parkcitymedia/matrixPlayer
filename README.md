# Blake's Proof Of Concept C++ OpenGL engine
## Ideas behind project:
- utilizing gl, GLFW3, and GLEW
- utilizing c++

## Running the thing
### linux:
yeah, i typically swap into my tasks dir and manually run build.sh && run.sh to quickly do a fresh comp-n-run of the program. nothing too fancy. buildRun.sh is not used all too much, and the outputs they create probably contain nothing except for error codes at the moment
